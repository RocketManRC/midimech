# Code of Conduct

When contributing and participating in project development and discussion,
members are expected to act in accordance to this rule:

Treat others with kindness and decency, as the way you would wish to be treated in their position.

Please be respectful of the wide range of cultural and religious differences
that exist in the world and be open to apologizing when conduct is unwelcome
or extending forgiveness to those willing to change for the better.

All involvement on the project should be productive, positive, and welcoming.
Keep discussions project-focused and avoid escalating personal matters.

If someone has made you feel unwelcome, please contact the developers.

Thank you and have fun!
